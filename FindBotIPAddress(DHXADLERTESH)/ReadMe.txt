To efficiently identify bot IP addresses in large log files by processing the logs in chunks, you can use the following algorithms and implementation strategies:

Algorithms for Bot Detection
Chunked File Processing:
Read the log file in manageable chunks to avoid high memory consumption.
1.Frequency Analysis:
For each chunk, count the occurrences of each IP address.
2.Rate Limiting:
Track requests per IP over specified time intervals while processing each chunk.
3.Pattern Matching:
Identify IPs based on specific patterns or behaviors indicative of bot activity.

MY Implementation
Processes the log file in chunks, counting the occurrences of each IP address:


Key Features of the Implementation
Async Programming : Can use Task to implement asyn programming and increase performance
Chunked Reading: The log file is read in 1 MB chunks, which helps manage memory usage effectively.
IP Extraction: Each line in the chunk is processed to extract IP addresses, even when multiple IPs are present.
Request Counting: A dictionary tracks the number of requests per IP address.
Thresholding: After processing, it identifies and prints IPs that exceed the specified request threshold.
Usage
Specify the Log File Path: Update the logFilePath variable to point to your log file.
Adjust the Threshold: Modify the requestThreshold to fit your traffic patterns.
Compile and Run: Execute the program to analyze the log file for potential bot activity.
This approach efficiently processes large log files while keeping memory usage in check, making it suitable for production environments. You can further enhance it by including timestamp filtering or advanced heuristics based on specific application patterns.

Note :- Can Write more test case but lack of time i just returning few for sample
